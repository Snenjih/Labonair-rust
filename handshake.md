# Handshake — Session State (Labonair-rust Port)

Authored by: GPUI-native port of Labonair (formerly Tauri v2 + React 19 → now pure Rust/GPUI).

> This file is the authoritative continuity doc for the **port** project. It supersedes the old Tauri-era history — that web-app work lives in the original repo (`../Labonair`), which is now a read-only **reference**. Do not mistake the old git history/tech for the current target.

## Last Session: 2026-08-31 (Roadmap complete + repo created + CLAUDE.md Next Task Protocol)

### What Was Done
- **Roadmap built out fully.** `tasks/ROADMAP.md` defines the 15-phase port (Setup → Theme → Terminal → Tabs → Explorer → Editor → SSH → SFTP → Git → Git-Graph → AI → Snippets/Palette → Settings → Session → Testing/Polish). 43 task files exist under `tasks/phase-*/` (each is instruction-only: context, goal, instructions, acceptance criteria, notes, warnings — no code). Naming: `T{NN}-{OOO}.md` where NN = phase 01–15, OOO = task number (files currently use the sequential scheme, e.g. `T01-001-setup-cargo-workspace.md`, `T13-001-settings-preferences.md`, `T15-004-packaging-release.md`). Next Task Protocol in CLAUDE.md consumes these in order.
- **Initial commit** `ead881a` committed the full repo (including the copied original source, kept as reference).
- **GitHub repo created & linked**: `gh repo create Labonair-rust --public --source=. --remote=origin --push` → remote `origin` set, `master` tracked to `origin/master`, URL https://github.com/Snenjih/Labonair-rust
- **CLAUDE.md rewritten** for the port (was stale Tauri/web content). Now documents: Rust/GPUI commands (`cargo check/build/run/clippy/test/fmt`), the single-binary GPUI architecture, Critical Rules (no web tech, reference-only original, GPU API must be source-verified), **Next Task Protocol** (the core task-by-task workflow), session start/end protocols, bug-memory rule, reference usage, language protocol.
- **handshake.md reset** for the port project (this file).

### Current State
- Branch `master`, repo pushed to `origin/master`.
- **First implementation task** (`T01-001-setup-cargo-workspace.md`) is the next to work — nothing implemented yet (only roadmap + config docs). `cargo` project has NOT yet been scaffolded.
- The original source files (src/, src-tauri/, docs/, package.json, etc. from the clone) still sit in the repo as an untracked-from-the-web-app reference. **These are reference artifacts for the port to read, NOT the app to extend.** Future phases will replace the web-tech portions.

### What's Next
1. Execute **T01-001-setup-cargo-workspace.md** per the Next Task Protocol in CLAUDE.md: scaffold the cargo workspace, set it up, verify (`cargo check`), mark `✅ Done`, update this handshake, commit.
2. Then T01-002 → T01-003 (reference symlink → `reference/`) → T01-004, and continue through the phases in order.

### Blockers
- None. Next task is dependency-clean (T01-001 has no dependencies).

## Previous Session: (none — port infrastructure only)

Project start. Created repo clone, initialized git, wrote the full task roadmap + task files. No application code written yet.
