# Rework progress — 2026-09-07

## Native visual verification

The exact Rust bundle was opened through its absolute `.app` path. Core
Graphics confirmed a visible layer-0 window for the exact bundled Rust PID;
the macOS screenshot API then denied capture because Screen Recording access
is unavailable in the runner. The legacy Tauri app was not used.

`scripts/screenshot.sh` now validates caller-provided PIDs against the exact
Rust executable before window lookup and distinguishes an invalid process from
macOS Screen Recording denial. This keeps visual evidence fail-closed.
## R02-003 completion

The user confirmed the native Rust shell visual state is acceptable, so the
visual acceptance criterion for `R02-003` is closed. Project and standalone
workspace identity now use the typed `WorkspaceTransition` contract with
session persistence and no cwd-based inference. `R03-001` is the next active
task.
